# xcover tests

This framework contains tests written using Nightwatch. It is using javascript.
It has page object model pattern, generates logs, generates XML/HTML reports and screenshots 

Nightwatch tests can be run in firefox 


##Necessary softwares/libraries/browser to be installed:

1. JAVA & JDK - below are the versions to be used
       java version "1.8.0_191"
       Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_191-b12)
       Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.191-b12, mixed mode)

2. Install firefox

3. Install node at least 8.12.0

4. Install yarn v1.13.0 (https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)

5. Install yarn add nightwatch


##Prerequisites to clone and setup the framework

1. Checkout repo from github --> https://github.com/sshankaregowda/webapptests-86400-part1.git 

2. Import the repo to VS code.

3. Open cmd and navigate to project location in VS code.

4. By default repo has template for .env files which is .env.xxx-xxx.template. Below are the ones for different test environment. These are just the samples to show the framework standards. Currently, for running xcover application, I have used .env.syd-dev.template because nightwatch requires env variable (--env syd-dev) to be specified while running the scripts.

.env.syd-dev.template
.env.pdx-dev.template
.env.pdx-prod.template
.env.syd-prod.template
.env.fra-prod.template
.env.local.template


##Steps to run the nightwatch tests

1. In commmand line enter
 yarn nightwatch --test tests/e2e/testcases/xcoverTest.js --env syd-dev  ---> to run the xcover application in sample test environment syd-dev which is already explained above.

2. Verify the XML and HTML reports generated under reports folder

3. Verify screenshots under screenshots folder

4. Verify log file - selenium-debug.log/selenium-server.log
